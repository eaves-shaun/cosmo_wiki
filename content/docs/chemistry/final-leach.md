## Theory
_This step is the last chance for cleaning the samples._

## Steps
1.1 Sketch the following table in your lab book:

|    |SampleID|Empty beaker+lid (g)|Beaker+lid+qtz (g)|Carrier weight (g)|
|----|--------|--------------------|------------------|------------------|
|1   |_ABC-1_ |           _210.225_|         _224.321_|          _0.9976_|
|..  |        |                    |                  |                  |
|... |        |                    |                  |                  |
|_n_ |_blank_ |                    |                  |                  |

1.2 Label and precisely weigh 90ml or 240ml Savillex screwtop jar and lid (1 per sample)
- [x] Add sample 
   - _maximum ~50g quartz in 90ml jar and maximum ~150g in 240ml jar_
   - _if using the quick dissolution, only use the largest Savillex jars_

- [ ] Add 7M HF (48% conc. HF (28M): Millipore H2O=1:3) till the sample is covered by ~5mm excess liquid
- [ ] Heat ~1 hour (maximum) @ 120°C with lid 
- [ ] Allow to cool and wash with Millipore H2O
	 - Note: 4x rinses per sample

- [ ] Add Aqua Regia (conc. (14M) HNO3: conc. (12M) HCl =1:3) till the sample is covered by ~5mm excess liquid
	 - Note: to make batch for ~13 samples (~500ml  of Aqua Regia), add 450ml HCl and 150ml HNO3

- [ ] Leave uncovered until all brown gas has gone, ~30 minutes
- [ ] Heat with lid ~1 hour minimum @ 120°C
	 - Note: if leaving for a long period (i.e. overnight), tighten lid and leave off hotplate

- [ ] Allow to cool and wash thoroughly with Millipore H2O (4-5 times)
- [ ] Dry sample on hotplate (over ½ day or overnight)
- [ ] Allow to cool to room temperature
- [ ] Take the precise weight (including Savillex jar and lid)
